# Basic-Weather-App
This is a pretty basic HTML weather app, feel free to improve it.

Hello there! I made this weather app quite some time ago, it uses: https://openweathermap.org/
to get data from for the app.

In the code, there is a: 

const API_KEY = "ENTER_YOUR_API_KEY"; // Replace with your OpenWeather API key

over there you have to go to openweathermap.org, make a free account and then access a prebuilt default API Key, what this does is fetch the info. If you don't understand, watch a youtube video on it :)
